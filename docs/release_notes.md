# Release Notes

## Unreleased
- Clarified that detector join correction targets plateau-style discontinuities while despiking addresses transient spikes, and updated the documentation/UI to reflect the full-spectrum despike workflow.
- Documented the availability of spike exclusion regions for preserving narrow features during despiking.
- Added a tail decay ratio control to UV/Vis despiking so recipes can chase broader spike shoulders when necessary, surfaced through the recipe editor and pipeline configuration.
