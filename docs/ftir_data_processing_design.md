# FTIR Data Processing Module – Design Overview

## 1. Objectives

- Parse and preprocess Bruker OPUS FTIR data files.
- Detect and fit spectral peaks reliably across varying baseline conditions.
- Derive chemical composition metrics using an integrated IR spectral reference database.
- Provide extendable workflows for calibration, validation, and reporting.

## 2. Scope & Deliverables

1. **File I/O & Metadata Handling**
   - Read OPUS binary files (spectra, interferograms, metadata).
   - Export to standardized internal representation (e.g., pandas DataFrame + metadata object).
   - Optional export to open formats (JCAMP-DX, CSV).

2. **Spectral Preprocessing Pipeline**
   - Wavenumber calibration and resampling.
   - Noise reduction (Savitzky–Golay, wavelet, etc.).
   - Baseline correction (rubber-band, asymmetric least squares).
   - Normalization/scaling strategies (vector, area, peak-based).
   - Quality-control hooks for flagging low SNR or missing regions.

3. **Peak Detection**
   - Configurable detection methods (derivative-based, continuous wavelet transform).
   - Peak validation heuristics (min/max width, prominence, SNR threshold).
   - Batch processing support.

4. **Peak Fitting**
   - Model library (Gaussian, Lorentzian, Voigt, pseudo-Voigt, custom).
   - Initial parameter estimation strategies.
   - Multi-peak deconvolution with constraints (shared widths, fixed ratios).
   - Goodness-of-fit metrics and diagnostics.

5. **Chemical Composition Determination**
   - IR reference database integration (compound spectra, annotations).
   - Peak-to-compound mapping (rule-based, ML classifier).
   - Quantification workflows (calibration curves, Beer-Lambert, multivariate regression).
   - Confidence scoring and uncertainty estimation.

6. **Calibration & Validation**
   - Datasets for calibration/validation splits.
   - Model performance metrics (RMSE, R², confusion matrix).
   - Cross-validation tooling.

7. **Reporting & Visualization**
   - Plotting utilities (raw vs. processed spectra, fitted peaks, residuals).
   - Summary reports (HTML/PDF/Markdown) including composition tables and QC flags.
   - Export of intermediate data (processed spectra, peak tables, concentration estimates).

8. **Extensibility & Configuration**
   - Modular pipeline configuration (YAML/JSON + Python API).
   - Plugin interfaces for new peak models, preprocessing steps, compound mapping strategies.

9. **CLI & API**
   - Command-line entry point for batch workflows.
   - Python API documentation and examples.

10. **Testing & Documentation**
   - Unit, integration, and regression tests (spectra fixtures, property-based tests).
   - Benchmark datasets for performance.
   - User/developer documentation (tutorials, API references).

## 3. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 – Foundations
1. Establish internal data structures for spectra and metadata.
2. Implement OPUS reader with test coverage using reference files.
3. Add preprocessing utilities (baseline, smoothing, normalization).
4. Create initial visualization helpers for QC.

### Phase 2 – Peak Analysis
1. Implement detection methods with configurable parameters.
2. Introduce peak fitting engine with model library and constraints.
3. Develop automated parameter initialization and fit evaluation metrics.
4. Validate on benchmark spectra; document performance.

### Phase 3 – Composition & Database Integration
1. Define schema and ingestion tools for IR reference database.
2. Implement mapping logic between detected peaks and reference signatures.
3. Build quantification framework (calibration curves, regression models).
4. Add confidence scoring and error propagation.

### Phase 4 – Tooling & Interfaces
1. Design configuration system for pipelines and workflows.
2. Implement CLI for batch processing.
3. Expand visualization/reporting features.
4. Draft comprehensive documentation and examples.

### Phase 5 – Quality & Release
1. Flesh out automated test suites and CI integration.
2. Conduct performance profiling and optimizations.
3. Prepare release notes, user guides, and hand-off materials.

## 4. Dependencies & Resources

- Libraries: `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib/plotly`, `lmfit` or custom optimizer, `brukeropusreader` (see <https://github.com/drbaa/brukeropusreader>) or `opusFC` for OPUS ingestion; a lightweight custom reader module will be drafted during Phase 1 if licensing gaps remain, with availability aligned to the initial pipeline prototype.
- Reference data: IR spectral database (format to be defined), calibration datasets, QC spectra.
- Tooling: `pytest`, `mypy`, documentation generator (Sphinx/MkDocs).

## 5. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Proprietary OPUS format nuances | Data loss / parsing errors | Use validated libraries, compile test corpus, add robust error handling. |
| Baseline variability | False peaks | Offer multiple correction methods and automated parameter tuning. |
| Peak overlap | Misidentification | Provide multi-component fitting, allow manual constraints, incorporate domain heuristics. |
| Database incompleteness | Inaccurate composition | Enable user-supplied references, highlight uncertainty, support iterative enrichment. |
| Performance on large batches | Slow processing | Optimize pipeline, parallelize critical sections, cache intermediate results. |

## 6. Open Questions

- Preferred internal units (cm⁻¹ vs. µm) and resampling granularity?
- Target throughput (number of spectra per batch) and runtime expectations?
- Licensing constraints for reference database redistribution?
- Need for GUI integration or purely backend/CLI?
- Requirements for integrating with existing workflows (LIMS, data lakes, etc.)?
